# Express

# About
A repostory with my express apps

## How It's Made:
Using Javascript, css, ejs and express

**Tech used:** Javascript, css, ejs, express 

I work on express to practice a mainstream framework


## Optimizations

I look for ways to reduce my run time complexities and revist code to add Big(O) notation



## Lessons Learned:
Express is a powerful framework that has both benefits and drawbacks. Both need to be analyized before deciding if express is right for you
